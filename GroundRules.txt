Python is a case sensitive language - "A" is not seen as "a"

Variable are a way of storing value. Put simply it is a name that represent a value.

Rules for Naming Variable in Python
1. variable names should not have spaces - date of birth (invalid), date_of_birth (valid)
2. variable names do not start with numbers - 12strong, 1hundred (invalid); strong_12, hundred1, ten10two (valid)
3. variable names should not be the same with keywords or reserved words (identifiers)
4. variable names cannot take in special characters - &^%$#@!~-)(/.,;'\][]

When there is an opening there should also be a closing
[ - opening; ] - closing
" - opening; " - closing
' - opening; ' - closing
( - opening; ) - closing
