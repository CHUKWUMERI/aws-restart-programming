Python is a case sensitive language - "A" is not seen as "a"

Variable are a way of storing value. Put simply it is a name that represent a value.


Rules for Naming Variable in Python
1. variable names should not have spaces - date of birth (invalid), date_of_birth (valid)
2. variable names do not start with numbers - 12strong, 1hundred (invalid); strong_12, hundred1, ten10two (valid)
3. variable names should not be the same with keywords or reserved words (identifiers)
4. variable names cannot take in special characters - &^%$#@!~-)(/.,;'\][]

When there is an opening there should also be a closing
[ - opening; ] - closing
" - opening; " - closing
' - opening; ' - closing
( - opening; ) - closing

Errors Exist! Get used to them! 
You would find the errors as an indication that you are not doing something right

Keywords in python can either be inbuilt functions or reserved words.
Python allows you to use the inbuilt functions as identifiers (variable names), however, you will break the program if you do something
To know the various inbuilt functions, you can visit the website: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

Reserved words on the other hand are words that have a defined meaning in python. It does not allow you to use them as variable names
